The council of your home town has decided to improve road sign placement, especially for dead ends. 
They have given you a road map, and you must determine where to put up signs to mark the dead ends. They want you to use as few signs as possible.
The road map is a collection of locations connected by two-way streets. The following rule describes how to obtain a complete placement of dead-end signs-
Consider a street S connecting a location with another location. 
The r-entrance of S gets a dead-end sign if, after entering S from r, it is not possible to come back to a without making a U-turn.
A U-turn is a 180- degree turn immediately reversing the direction.
To save costs, you have decided not to install redundant dead-end signs, as specified by the following.
Consider a street S with a dead-end sign at its r-entrance and another street T with a dead-end sign at its. 
If, after entering S from x, it is possible to go to y and enter T without making a U-turn, the dead-end sign at the y-entrance of T is redundant.
